<h1>Self Promotion Guidelines</h1>
<small><strong>Last updated on 20th October 2018</strong>, adapted from the tabletop.social self promotion guideline <a
        href="https://gist.github.com/MxFraud/92128019a16c97b4009e6d142b20b7a6">available here</a>.
</small>

<p>
    You are welcome and encouraged to have an account for your (tabletop related) company or an account for an actual game on d20hero.club. To make everyone's stay enjoyable, here are the set of rules you need to follow:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Any Self promotion post or marketing post needs to be unlisted at all time, have a CW, done in low volume and with some context (do showcase your work)</strong></li>
    <li>The game or company main operator must be included in its description or a pinned post.</li>
    <li>Games and company account must clearly state what they are in their display name.</li>
    <li>Your game or company account must only follow users after receiving consent (@ them and ask if they are OK with you following them from your game or company account, maybe give people a little insight into why).</li>
    <li>Your game or company account must only boost toot after receiving consent (only required for users your game or company account doesn't follow already).</li>
    <li>Your game and company account must never mention other users unless the mentioned user has initiated it.</li>
    <li>Your game or company account must follow the same rules as normal users, with regards to acceptable content, harassment, etc.</li>
    <li>If you respect the above rules, yet only do self promotion/marketing, you'll be suspended.</li>
</ul>

Failure to follow these rules will result in the account being suspended. Understand that people accross the fediverse will start silencing all content from d20hero.club and therefor harm the community if we don't stick to these rules.
