<h1>Bot Policy</h1>
<small><strong>Last updated on 20th October 2018</strong>, adapted from the sleeping.town bot policy <a
        href="https://gist.github.com/unascribed/f7c2f5db90831b63e09286d3c7b01026">available here</a>.
</small>

<p>
    Bot accounts are welcome, provided they follow these rules:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>All Markov bots or other generative bots that may output nonsense must always post unlisted, or with
        a CW.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>If a bot will post public posts, it must not post any more frequently than once an hour and must be clearly
        marked as a bot in its display name.
    </li>
    <li>Bots must never mention other users unless the mentioned user has initiated it. For such user-initiated posts,
        any rate limits may be ignored.
    </li>
    <li>The bot's operator must be included in its description or a pinned post.</li>
    <li>Top-level unlisted or followers-only posts must not be made any more frequently than every 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Exception: Now-playing or scrobble bots may post as frequently as once a minute.</li>
    <li>If a bot incorporates data from posts made by another user that are not directed at the bot, the bot must be
        following that user.
    </li>
    <li>Bots must follow the same rules as normal users, with regards to acceptable content, harassment, etc.</li>
    <li>Generative bots must be monitored by their operator.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Failure to follow these rules may result in the bot being suspended. A bot's operator is responsible for all content posted by it.
</p>

<p>
    Open source bots are encouraged, and should have a link to their source code in their description or a pinned post.
</p>
