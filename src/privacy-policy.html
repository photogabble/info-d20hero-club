<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<small>
    <strong>Last updated on 20th October 2018</strong>, adapted from the Mastodon
    privacy policy <a href="https://mastodon.social/terms">available here</a>.
</small>

<p>
    Simon Dann ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://d20hero.club website (the "Service", "Server").
</p>

<p>
    We have tried to keep our privacy policy simple and free from legal jargon. The core value of this service is to put
    you first and that means providing a service that doesn't compromise your privacy. Below we explain what we ask from
    you and why as well as the choices you have associated with the data you disclose.
</p>

<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>

<h4>Basic account information:</h4>
<p>
    If you <a href="https://d20hero.club/registration">register</a> on this server you will be asked to enter a
    username,
    a display name, an email address and a password. Upon registration you may also enter additional profile information
    such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture and header image.
</p>

<p>
    The username, display name, biography, profile picture and header image are always listed publicly.
</p>

<h4>Posts, following and other public information:</h4>

<p>
    The list of people you follow is listed publicly, the same is true for your followers. When you submit a message,
    the date and time is stored as well as the application you submitted the message from. Messages may contain media
    attachments, such as pictures and videos. Public and unlisted posts are available publicly. When you feature a post
    on your profile, that is also publicly available information. Your posts are delivered to your followers, in some
    cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is
    likewise delivered to your followers. The action of reblogging or favouriting another post is always public.
</p>

<h4>Direct and followers-only posts:</h4>

<p>
    All posts are stored and processed on the server. Followers-only posts are delivered to your followers and users who
    are mentioned in them, and direct posts are delivered only to users mentioned in them. In some cases it means they
    are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there.
</p>

<p>
    We make a good faith effort to limit the access to those posts only to authorized persons, but other servers may
    fail to do so. Therefore it's important to review servers your followers belong to. You may toggle an option to
    approve and reject new followers manually in the settings.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Please keep in mind that the operators of the server and any receiving server may view such
        messages</strong>, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. <strong>Do not share
    any dangerous information over d20hero.club</strong>.
</p>

<h4>
    IPs and other metadata:
</h4>

<p>
    When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The
    latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of
    every request to our server.
</p>

<h2>What do we use your information for?</h2>

<p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To provide the core functionality of d20hero.club. You can only interact with other people's content and post your
        own content when you are logged in. For example, you may follow other people to view their combined posts in
        your own personalized home timeline.
    </li>
    <li>To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban
        evasion or other violations.
    </li>
    <li>The email address you provide will only be used to send you a password reset link, or to respond to inquiries,
        and/or other requests or questions.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>

<p>
    We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter,
    submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic
    between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way
    algorithm.
</p>

<h2>What is our data retention policy?</h2>

<p>We will make a good faith effort to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no
        more than 90 days.
    </li>
    <li>Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12 months.</li>

</ul>
<p>You can request and download an archive of your content, including your posts, media attachments, profile
    picture, and header image.</p>

<p>You may irreversibly delete your account at any time.</p>

<h2>Do we use cookies?</h2>

<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through
    your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a
    registered account, associate it with your registered account.</p>

<p>We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.</p>

<h2>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h2>

<p>
    We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does
    not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so
    long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we
    believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights,
    property, or safety.
</p>

<p>
    Your public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and followers-only posts are
    delivered to the servers where your followers reside, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the
    recipients, in so far as those followers or recipients reside on a different server than this.
</p>

<p>
    When you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may
    access your public profile information, your following list, your followers, your lists, all your posts, and your
    favourites. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password.
</p>

<h2>Security Of Data</h2>

<p>
    The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or
    method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
    Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>

<h2>Compromise of Personal Information</h2>

<p>
    In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, d20hero.club will
    promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, via the email address linked to
    affected accounts, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
</p>

<h2>Site usage by children</h2>

<p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent
    or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become
    aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to
    remove that information from our servers.</p>

<h2>Promises</h2>

<p>This privacy policy is about what we do but we also think it's important to talk about what we won't do. We will:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Never sell your personal data</li>
    <li>Never spam you</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
