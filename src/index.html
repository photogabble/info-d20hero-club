<p>
    The aim of <a href="https://d20hero.club">d20hero.club</a> is to be an inclusive <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma">Pleroma</a>
    community for everything tabletop. We welcome anyone who wants to be part of the community be you a boardgamer, RPG player, LARPer, artist or other.
</p>

<p>
    This is meant to be a positive and safe space for people to enjoy each other's ideas, opinions and have fun. To keep d20hero.club that way, the
    <a href="/tos">code of conduct and rules</a> will be applied and enforced thoroughly and transparently.
</p>

<h3>Rules, Etiquette, Bots, block list</h3>

<ul>
    <li>This is a Bot friendly instance, bot accounts are welcome provided they follow <a href="/bot-policy">these rules</a></li>
    <li>You are welcome and encouraged to have an account for your (tabletop related) company or an account for an actual game provided you follow our <a href="/self-promotion-guidelines">self promotion guidelines</a></li>
    <li>Please browse our <a href="/tos">code of conduct and rules</a> for a detailed list of what is and isn't acceptable on this instance</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We generally have an open federation policy. However, at the discretion of the instance admin &amp; moderation team,
    we may modify that policy with some instances. The federated timeline on d20 Heroes is not curated, but there's
    certain instances we are just not going to deal with.
</p>

<p>You can view our current <a href="/federation">federation policy here</a>.</p>

<h2>Viable alternatives</h2>

<p>
    We welcome main accounts and alternative accounts. If you only have one account on the fediverse, we highly recommend the creation of a
    second alternative account as a backup.

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>
    This instance is hosted on a C1 baremetal dedicated box hosted in Paris by <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/baremetal-cloud-servers/">Scaleway</a>. It boasts a
    quad core ARMv7 with 2GB of RAM and 200Mbit/s connectivity. This works out to be around â‚¬2.99/mo (depending on GBP-EUR exchange rate) and so is affordable for me
    to fund entirely at leisure.
</p>

<p>
    I will personally endeavour to keep the instance running 24/7 365 days of the year. If this instance becomes popular enough to require it, it will be migrated to a load
    balanced solution.

<h2>Who is behind this?</h2>

<p>
    Hi, I am <a href="https://github.com/carbontwelve">Simon</a>. I am a software engineer and primarily work with the PHP and Go languages. I setup d20hero.club to
    provide a viable option for those in the tabletop gaming community who are affected by the pending
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117817751909237129167">G+</a> shutdown.
