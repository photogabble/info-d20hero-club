<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>
    This instance is hosted on a C1 baremetal dedicated box hosted in Paris by <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/baremetal-cloud-servers/">Scaleway</a>. It boasts a
    quad core ARMv7 with 2GB of RAM and 200Mbit/s connectivity. This works out to be around €2.99/mo (depending on GBP-EUR exchange rate) and so is affordable for me
    to fund entirely at leisure.
</p>

<p>
    I will personally endeavour to keep the instance running 24/7 365 days of the year. If this instance becomes popular enough to require it, it will be migrated to a load
    balanced solution.

    Hi, I am <a href="https://github.com/carbontwelve">Simon</a>. I am a software engineer and primarily work with the PHP and Go languages. I setup d20hero.club to
    provide a viable option for those in the tabletop gaming community who are affected by the pending
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/117817751909237129167">G+</a> shutdown.
