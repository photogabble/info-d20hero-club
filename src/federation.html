<h1>Federation Status</h1>
<small><strong>Last updated on 22nd October 2018</strong>, based upon settings from <a href="https://beeping.town/static/federation.html">beeping.town</a>, <a href="https://info.pleroma.site/federation.html">pleroma.site</a> &amp; <a href="http://glittery.nipple.solutions/">glitterkitten</a></small>

<p>
    d20 Heroes generally has an open federation policy. However, at the discretion of the instance admin &amp; moderation team,
    we may modify that policy with some instances. The federated timeline on d20 Heroes is not curated, but there's
    certain instances we are just not going to deal with.
</p>

<p>
    d20 Heroes participates in MRF transparency. Users may verify the running configuration by
    <a href="https://d20hero.club/nodeinfo/2.0.json">viewing our NodeInfo data</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Overall, we try to avoid blocking whole instances, but we have the capability. Instead, we prefer to take less
    intrusive actions to solve problems. As such, this is our current policy:
</p>

<h2>Instances with federated timeline removal</h2>

<p>
    These instances can interact with us, but their posts won't appear on the public timeline. You can still follow
    users from these instances and receive their posts on your personal timeline.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>switter.at</li>
    <li>kinky.business</li>
    <li>pl.smuglo.li</li>
    <li>sealion.club</li>
    <li>voluntaryism.club</li>
    <li>freezepeach.xyz</li>
    <li>loli.estate</li>
    <li>youkai.town</li>
    <li>blackandgold.xyz</li>
    <li>liberdon.com</li>
    <li>melalandia.tk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rejected instances</h2>

<p>
    Rejected instances can't interact with us, and their posts won't appear on the public timeline. This is otherwise
    called defederation and is reserved as the nuclear option.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>albin.social</strong> &mdash; This instance is entirely defederated due to strong concerns about data mining and advertising (spam). <a href="http://glittery.nipple.solutions/albin-social">Click here for more information.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Media Removal</h2>

<p>
    Instances with media removal will not have their media (uploaded images/videos) shown inside our instance, but you
    can still follow the link to their profile to see it.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>None currently</li>
</ul>

<h2>#NSFW Rewrite</h2>

<p>
    These instances will have their messages containing media marked #nsfw and sensitive automatically. This is due to a
    large possibility that the message may contain content that violates our policies. In the interests of ensuring that
    content which does not violate our policies may still be viewed, we mark the images #nsfw and sensitive instead of
    removing them altogether.
